            <p><em>Application Developer at <strong><a href="https://www.google.com"> Google</a>.</strong></em></p>
            <p>I am currently working as an application developer who focuses on Java at the moment. Prior to that I was a web application developer
                and have developed multiple scripts in multiple programming language. The reason why I am taking this course is to refresh my knowledge
                into web development and to be able to create websites for the future.
